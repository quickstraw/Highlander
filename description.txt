Highlander is a content mod that focuses on adding fun items that add variety to gameplay. All the content should be compatible with multiplayer.

[IMPORTANT]
Please let me know if you find any issues with the mod.

Features:
        - 3 Bosses
        - 1 Town NPCs
        - Many items to add variety to gameplay

Various items added are rewards for beating the bosses as well as some odd weapons I thought would fit well into Terraria and add variety. These items generally have a twist that makes their mechanics unique.

Town NPCs:
Conquistador - Currently sells some pikes and aggressive ale. In the future, he will sell random misc items I decide to add.

Recent Changes:
1.5.1.0 - Improved the sprites for Idol of Enlightenment. Improved some item sprites.
1.5.0.2 - Stopped Chariot's Whip from spawning (It's broken after the 1.4 update). Changed the Ancient Stone Blaster sprite to be smaller.
1.5.0.0 - Split of the hats from this mod and put them into Hat Simulator. Updated the mod to 1.4.4. Updated to new localization changes.

Currently Working On:
- Updating some sprites to look better.
