Highlander is a content mod that focuses on adding mostly cosmetic items. Everything should work in multiplayer.

[IMPORTANT]
I have just updated this mod to 1.4. I haven't extensively tested anything in 1.4 yet. Some features seem to have broken, and I'm still trying to fix them.

Features:
        - 3 Bosses
        - 2 Town NPCs
        - 40+ vanity items
        - Several non-vanity items to add variety to gameplay

Many cosmetic items added are inspired by Team Fortress 2 cosmetics. The Haunted Hatter must be killed to acquire these items. Hat Lock Boxes will drop after the Haunted Hatter is killed.

There are 4 Hat Lock Boxes that can be opened to obtain different sets of hats. A Hat Lock Box must be opened with a key bought from the Hat Salesman. There is a small chance to obtain a hat with an unusual effect after opening a Hat Lock Box.

Non-cosmetic items added are rewards for beating the bosses as well as some odd weapons I thought would fit well into Terraria and add variety. These items generally have a twist that makes their mechanics unique.

Recent Changes:
1.4.5.0 - Updated to 1.4 stable beta.

Currently Working On:
Remaking sprites and fixing bugs that have appeared in 1.4.
