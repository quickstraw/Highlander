Highlander is a content mod that focuses on adding mostly cosmetic items. There is currently a new boss, 2 new town NPCs, and many cosmetic items along with a few non-cosmetic items.

Many cosmetic items added are inspired by Team Fortress 2 cosmetics. The Haunted Hatter must be killed to acquire these items. Hat Lock Boxes will drop after the Haunted Hatter is killed.

There are 2 Hat Lock Boxes that can be opened to obtain different sets of hats. A Hat Lock Box must be opened with a key bought from the Hat Salesman. There is a small chance to obtain a hat with an unusual effect after opening a Hat Lock Box.

Non-cosmetic items added are rewards for beating the Haunted Hatter as well as some odd weapons I thought would fit well into Terraria.

One of these weapons is the pike. There are 3 pike items added that serve as a long-range melee weapons with a bonus versus bosses. They are not very good at close range combat.
