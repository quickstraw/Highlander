Highlander is a content mod that focuses on adding mostly cosmetic items.

Features:
        - 3 Bosses
        - 2 Town NPCs
        - 40+ vanity items
        - Several non-vanity items to add variety to gameplay

Many cosmetic items added are inspired by Team Fortress 2 cosmetics. The Haunted Hatter must be killed to acquire these items. Hat Lock Boxes will drop after the Haunted Hatter is killed.

There are 4 Hat Lock Boxes that can be opened to obtain different sets of hats. A Hat Lock Box must be opened with a key bought from the Hat Salesman. There is a small chance to obtain a hat with an unusual effect after opening a Hat Lock Box.

Non-cosmetic items added are rewards for beating the bosses as well as some odd weapons I thought would fit well into Terraria and add variety. These items generally have a twist that makes their mechanics unique.

Recent Changes:
1.4.2.2 - Added new Unusual effects (Amaranthine, Stare From Beyond, and The Ooze). Added more Halloween hats. Improved sprites for some other hats.
1.4.2.3 - Fixed some subtle graphical glitches with the larger hats. Fixed some mounts not having the proper offset for effects.

Currently Working On:
Maybe make more original hats
